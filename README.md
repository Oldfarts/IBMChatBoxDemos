# IBMChatBoxDemo

This demo creates a chatbox inside the IBM Cloud with given credentials.
Before you can start to test the project, user must create manually DB2, connectors and etc to IBM cloud

There is also a ESP8266 device project in this demo, that is able to write also into DB2.
To get the device demo to work is to get the certificate from the server 1st and changing it to code

There are couple of extra files still, when I have time, I will remove them from the project... but those do not do any harm...
